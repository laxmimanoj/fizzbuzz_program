Requirements
Create a command line application that takes three parameters [P1, D1, and D2].  The application will print the numbers 1 to P1 (inclusive), one number per line, except in the following cases:
1) If the number is evenly divisible by D1 it should print "Fizz"
2) If the number is evenly divisible by D2 it should print "Buzz"
3) If the number is evenly divisible by both D1 and D2 "FizzBuzz" should be printed
Assume all inputs to the application will be correct (don't bother doing error checking) and use any language and/or technology you are comfortable with.
